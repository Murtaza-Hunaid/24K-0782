Q. Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

Ask the user to enter Number
Ask the user to enter Divisor
Divide the Number by Divisor
If a remainder is left, Display Divisor is not a divisor of Number
If a remainder is not left, Display Divisor is a divisor of Number
Divide Divisor by 2
If a remainder is left, Display Divisor is an odd number
If a remainder is not left, Display Divisor is an even number
