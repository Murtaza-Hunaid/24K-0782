Q. Create a small calculator which only does ‘+’ or ‘-‘ Operations. (Hint: Take three variable inputs with
one being used for the operator)

START
    PRINT("Enter two numbers: ")
    INPUT Num1, Num2
    REPEAT
        PRINT("Enter an operator: ")
        INPUT Operator
        IF Operator == "+"
            THEN
                Answer = Num1 + Num2
        ELSEIF Operator == "-"
                Answer = Num1 - Num2
    UNTIL Operator = "+" OR Operator = "-"
END
